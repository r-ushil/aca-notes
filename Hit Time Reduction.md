#Caches 

Dividing the cache into banks:
- Supports multiple parallel accesses to the cache
- Map addresses to banks in some other way (low order bits / hash function)

Multi-ported RAM - support multiple reads to multiple addresses every cycle

Use a smaller cache (faster lookups)
Use a direct-mapped cache (or use [[Way Prediction]])
