#Caches 

Reducing instruction cache-misses:
- Choose an instruction memory layout based on the callgraph of the program
- Load instruction blocks into I$ that are needed at the same time

Merge arrays - Compound 2d arrays to improve **spacial locality**
Loop fusion - Fuse loops that access the same variables
